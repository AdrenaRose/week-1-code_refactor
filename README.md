# week-1-code_refactor
Bootcamp challenge week one - HTML, CSS, GIT Code Refactoring

## Description
This project was completed as a homework assignment in week one of my University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp. It introduced me to what the meaning and process of refactoring code is. The project also reinforced what we have learned about utilizing semantic html and css styling by requiring the use of both for full completion of this project. I learned that I find it much more difficult to refactor exisiting code than it is to just start from scratch.
